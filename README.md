## Thesis

The results of comparison, by objective and subjective assessment of sound quality, of signals processing algorithms in the multi-microphone arrays are refined. These Matlab scripts were made for subjective comparison of two algorithms of space-time processing based on the criterion of musical signal quality. Music signal distorted by additive interference allows us to recommend a simpler, from the point of the calculations view, algorithm of the sum and delays instead of the more complicated competitive algorithm.
